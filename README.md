INDIVIDUAL PROJECT: C++ Framework that uses DirectX 11 and 3D directories with 2D-gaming environment

Goal: C++ DirectX Game to Score up to 20

Note: A DirextX 3D game I made back when I finished up back in high school. Easy API interface to make an excuetable program to intialize an algorithm
that let the user move in a 2D array/if-else coordinations in real time environment.
